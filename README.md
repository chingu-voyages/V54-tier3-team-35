## AskIQ 🤖👨‍💻

## Project Overview 📚

AskIQ helps users optimise their AI interactions by guiding them to structure their queries more effectively. With a focus on precision, the app enables users to craft well-defined requests, ensuring that AI responses are more accurate and relevant. By sending these structured queries to Google Gemini, AskIQ unlocks the full potential of AI.

## Project Features/Functionalities ⚙️

- **JWT-based User Authentication:**
Secure user login and registration with hashed passwords stored in the database.

- **Custom Query Input:** A pentagram-style form where users can create and submit custom queries to the AI model by filling in five key components.
   
   *1- Persona:*   Defines the character or perspective of the AI (e.g., expert, teacher, friend).
   
   *2- Context:*   Provides background information or situational details relevant to the query.
   
   *3- Task:*   Specifies the action or goal the AI should focus on (e.g., solving a problem, answering a question).
   
   *4- Output:* Details the desired outcome or format for the AI's response (e.g., list, explanation, code).
   
   *5- Constraint:* Any limitations or specific conditions the AI should consider when formulating its response (e.g., word count, tone, specific knowledge).

- **AI Response Interaction:**
Users can view, edit, or create new responses to previously submitted queries.

- **History Tracking:**
Keeps track of all previous user prompts in the sidebar for easy access to past interactions.

- **Error Handling:**
Input validation and error handling for missing or invalid inputs to ensure smooth user experience.

- **GIF Animations:**
Dynamic animations for both desktop and mobile interfaces, showcasing the app's functionality in action.
